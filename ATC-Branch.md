## ATC Branch

the main focus of this branch is to bring Bart's [ATC_Experiments branch](https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC/tree/ATC_Experiments) to the current codebase.

ATC is a feature that is [not planned](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/features/atc) to be part of the core development. 
To create a better starting point for developers interested in the ATC implementation, this implementation abandons the commit history of ATC_Experiments in favor of feature based commits.
Please see [ATC_Experiments branch](https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC/tree/ATC_Experiments) for the full history.
